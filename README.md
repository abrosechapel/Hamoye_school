# Hamoye_school

Dear Hamoye team,

I am very disappointed for the result of the test, i have tried really hard for several days but I simply didn't get the expected result that's why I want to apologize with all the team because i didn't achieve the goals. It would be great if you can help me, I am going to search from improve it too. The score is so low, even if it is my first time building this kind of models I am so embarrassed, I understand if you don't let me move to the next stage because this result is poor.

Best regards
